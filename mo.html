        Finally, in order to avoid misinterpretations and to demonstrate our genuine desire for peace, specifically the loss of life and bloodshed, we have prepared for the French authorities an honourable document for discussion, if they are in good faith, which would definitively recognize the right of the peoples who colonize them to self-determination.
Recognition of Algerian nationality in a public and official manner, thus abolishing all the words, decisions and laws that make Algeria a French territory despite the history, geography, language, religion and customs of the Algerian people..
Open negotiations with the authorized representatives of the Algerian people on the basis of recognition of Algerian sovereignty and indivisible unity..<br>
Create an atmosphere of trust by releasing all political prisoners, lifting special procedures and stopping any manhunt against the fighting forces.in return, French interests, whether cultural or economic, obtained with integrity, will be respected, as Will individuals and families..
All French who wish to remain in Algeria have a choice between their nationality of origin and are thus considered as foreigners under the laws in force or choose Algerian nationality .in this case, they are considered as Algerians with their rights and duties. the ties between France and Algeria shall be determined and shall be the subject of an agreement between the two powers on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

O Algerian, we call on you to bless this document, and your duty is to join in saving our country and to work to restore its freedom, for the National Liberation Front is your front, and its victory is your victory. We, determined to continue the struggle, confident in your anti-imperialist sentiments, are giving the homeland the same things we have."Conqueror November 1954 National Secretariat.1
International strategy of the National Liberation Front party 1954-1962:
Major directions of diplomatic activity:
The goal of the National Liberation Front was to emerge from the radical wing of ï´¿ m.t.l. in independence by armed struggle .To achieve this, his major concerns remained consistent with the current emanating from him .This is evidenced by the statement of November 1, 1954:
...Our purpose in the external field is:<br>
Internationalization of the Algerian issue
Achieving the unity of North Africa in its Arab-Islamic landscape
Our position in the circle of the Charter of the United Nations is to affirm our active sympathy and solidarity with all nations that support our liberation struggle.
To that end ...<br>The FLN will take external action to make the Algerian problem a reality before the whole world with the support of all our natural allies)
The holding of the first conference of the front (the somam Conference of 20 August 1956)will determine its activity at the international level, highlighting the specificity of Algeria and its struggle . Thus, the program of the sammam conference was considered among the objectives of the party:
- Isolate France from Algeria and from the world politically.
